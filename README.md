# Opvia Take-home Product Challenge

Congratulations! This is the last stage before the final interview. It's your opportunity show how you build, so we weight it very highly.

## How to complete this stage of the interview process

1. Please clone this repo and use it as your starting point
2. Complete the 'Opvia product problem' below
3. When you are done, create a private repo and push your code to it
4. Invite _hfmw_ & _Albertopvia_ to view the repo

## Opvia product problem

Scientists are automatically uploading their data from bioreactors into Opvia. To help you, some example data is already loaded into a table.

In the example data, each row shows the density of the cells and the total volume in the bioreactor at a given point in time.

The scientists want to calculate the cell count at any point in time, as well as being able to see the maximum cell count.

Instead of building in these features, we have identified two higher level features to build which would solve their problem, and would be useful to all of our customers:

1. `Calculation columns`, these are columns in the table that are populated based on a user defined formula e.g. A cell count column that is created by the formula: `Cell Density * Volume`
2. A `Column Aggregations` feature which allows a user to perform operations on a selected data column, such as showing the `Maximum Density`, `Minimum Cell Count`, etc...

You have a meeting scheduled with the scientist who is a customer. Build something they will be use on your laptop to give you feedback. Please use <a href="https://blueprintjs.com/">Blueprintjs</a>.

Put any notes and your instructions in the README as well as what you would do next to improve this. Please also answer how you would make it possible to do `Rate of change calculations` e.g. `Rate of Cell Count Growth`

#### FAQS

-   Not sure about something? Please ask! Email `will@opvia.io` and cc `alberto@opvia.io`.
-   How should I communicate? Please over communicate. Please ask questions.
-   What are you looking for? The goal is to get feedback on the features specified. It needs to deliver the specified features well, being easy to use and making a good impression on the customer.
-   Unsure whether to submit? Would you be happy to sit next to a customer and let them test it on your laptop?
-   Ran out of time? Make this clear in the readme, and write out what you would do next.
